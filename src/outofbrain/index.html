          OutOfBrain is an application for developing and running multi-agent systems based on graph rewriting.
          I developed OutOfBrain in 2004, and worked on it till 2008. My goal was to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">symbolic AI</a> (as opposed to a connectionist AI).
          Ideally, the system would learn from its environment and adapt to it, and we as observing humans would be able to see and understand how it works (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">explainable AI</a>).
          <br />
          <br />
          OutOfBrain is a multi-agent system that runs in an executable graph, where instructions and memory reside in the same space.
          The executable graph is visualized in real-time, showing what the agents are doing, and allows for changing their behavior on the fly.
          Moreover, OutOfBrain is a client-server program, such that multiple developers can view and edit the same graph in real-time.

          <br />
          The following screenshots give an impression of the programming model of OutOfBrain.

          OutOfBrain could solve simple puzzles, but it was not yet able to learn from its environment and adapt to it.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2005 I attended <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/AAMAS/aamas05/main.html" target="_blank">AAMAS-05</a>, the fourth international joint conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (by <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/" target="_blank">IFAAMAS</a>) in Utrecht, The Netherlands.
          I got to speak with Albert van Breemen, who was working at the time for Philips on iCat, a robotic research platform for studying social human-robot interaction.
          We got talking about OutOfBrain and he invited me to come to Eindhoven to give a presentation.
          I went to Eindhoven and gave a presentation about OutOfBrain to a group of researchers at Philips Research.
          I was hoping that the researchers at Philips would see the potential of OutOfBrain as a platform in their research on social human-robot interaction.
          Alas, there was no follow-up.
          <br />
          <br />
          I then got into contact with professor Rineke Verbrugge at the University of Groningen (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences - Artificial Intelligence - Multi-Agent Systems Group).
          This led to Joris IJsselmuiden doing his master thesis in 2006 on using OutOfBrain as a platform for studying qualitative decision theory and graph rewriting.
          We worked on developing an Adaptive Diary Assistant, a multi-agent system that uses qualitative decision theory to help the user plan his or her day, based on the user's preferences and current state.
          Joris is a very smart person, and I learned a lot from him.
          We got the Adaptive Diary Assistant partially working, but ran out of time and did not complete the whole application.
          We learned that when building applications in OutOfBrain, the total graph got very large, and time-consuming to program and refactor.
