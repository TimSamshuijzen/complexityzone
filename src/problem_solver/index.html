    Problem Solver is a novel problem-solver and problem-analyzer for JavaScript programmers, CS students and AI (Artificial Intelligence) enthusiasts.<br />
    <br />
    Need help solving a puzzle or problem? Follow these steps:<br />
    <br />
    1. Describe the situation (world) with HTML and CSS.<br />
    2. Describe possible changes with JavaScript.<br />
    3. Evaluate the resulting worlds with JavaScript.<br />
    4. Explore the resulting possibilities with the "multiverse viewer".<br />
    <br />
    Essentially, Problem Solver is a "game tree viewer". It  presents you with a visualization of the "game tree", as it is called in CS or AI.
    In Problem Solver this is called the "multiverse".<br />
    <br />
    Although Problem Solver is technically a general problem solver, it is not intended for solving very complex problems. Problem Solver is merely a tool for gaining understanding and 
    appreciation for the nature and complexity of a problem of interest.<br />
